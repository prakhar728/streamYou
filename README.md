# StreamYou - A Revolution in Online Content Creation

Empower content creators with a decentralized platform that provides privacy, security, and ownership of their work.

**Problem Solved**

Online content creators often lack control over their content and are forced to rely on centralized platforms that take a large cut of their earnings. Decentralized streamYou enables the content creators to establish a true, and personal connection with their fans, helping them monetize their talents safely and securely.

**Challenges Faced**

During the development of our platform, our team had to study and evaluate various different technologies to ensure we were building the most secure, fast, and reliable platform for content creators. We embraced this learning process and explored different blockchain technologies to ensure we were leveraging the best tech stack for our use case.

**Technologies Used**

* Smart Contracts
* Huddle01 (decentralized video conferencing)
* Lighthouse Storage (decentralized content storage)
* NFT-based locking conditions
* Polybase (decentralized data storage)
* Filecoin EVM (FEVM) Network

**How We Implemented These Technologies**

Our platform relies heavily on the Ethereum blockchain and Solidity programming language for smart contract development. We implemented Huddle01 for secure video conferencing, Lighthouse Storage for content storage, and Polybase for decentralized data storage. The use of NFT-based locking conditions provides an advanced layer of security to our platform. Additionally, we hosted our smart contracts on the Filecoin EVM (FEVM) network for seamless integration with the larger filecoin ecosystem, resulting in faster transaction processing and reduced costs. Overall, the Decentralized OnlyFans platform was built with state-of-the-art technologies reflecting our commitment to provide a secure, fast, and reliable platform for content creators.

**Conclusion**

We believe that a decentralized platform like Decentralized OnlyFans is the future of online content creation, empowering and enabling creators around their content. Our platform is built with state-of-the-art technologies and is designed to ensure privacy, security, and ownership of content. Hosting our smart contracts on the Filecoin EVM network ensures seamless integration with the larger filecoin ecosystem while providing faster transaction processing and reduced costs.
